# Poeticlore ✨

A digital album of logic, art, and endless ideas.  

## About  
Poeticlore is where imagination meets logic, blending code and creativity into projects that reflect my evolving skills and vision. This repository is home to my portfolio, experiments, and future tech dreams.  

## What to Expect  
- Personal projects – Web development, design, and programming.  
- Creative experiments – Aesthetic and functional tech explorations.  
- Work in progress – Always evolving, always learning.  

## Inspiration  
Every project is shaped by the things I love—Nintendo, VHS, Y2K, and cozy digital aesthetics. I draw from nostalgia, futurism, and everything in between to create something unique.
